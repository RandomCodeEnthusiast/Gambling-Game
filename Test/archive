Certainly! To account for the dealer's aces, you should treat the dealer as an extra "player" in your ace-tracking system.  
Here's how to do it:

---

## 1. **Initialize Aces.txt for Dealer + Players**

When you set up `Aces.txt`, add one extra slot for the dealer (e.g., first or last line):

````python
# ...existing code...
# Dealer is at index 0, players start at index 1
total_players = len(PlayerCount)
FileWriter(projectpath() + r'\BlackJack\Aces.txt', '\n'.join(['0'] * (total_players + 1)))
# ...existing code...
````

---

## 2. **Assign DealerPosition Consistently**

Set `DealerPosition = 0` and players as `PlayerOrder + 1` everywhere you call ace-related functions:

````python
# ...existing code...
DealerPosition = 0
DealerScore = BlackJackSetup(Dealer, DealerPosition)
# ...existing code...
for PlayerOrder, PlayerNumber in enumerate(PlayerCount):
    PlayerScore = BlackJackSetup(Player, PlayerOrder + 1)
    PlayerScores.append(PlayerScore)
# ...existing code...
````

---

## 3. **Update ScoreCalc, SaveAces, CheckAces to Use New Indexing**

No changes needed in logic, just ensure you pass the correct index (dealer: 0, players: 1+).

---

## 4. **Summary of Indexing**

- `Aces.txt` line 0: Dealer's ace count
- `Aces.txt` line 1: Player 1's ace count
- `Aces.txt` line 2: Player 2's ace count
- etc.

---

## 5. **Example: BlackJackSetup and Draw Usage**

````python
# ...existing code...
DealerPosition = 0
DealerScore = BlackJackSetup(Dealer, DealerPosition)
# ...existing code...
for PlayerOrder, PlayerNumber in enumerate(PlayerCount):
    PlayerScore = BlackJackSetup(Player, PlayerOrder + 1)
    PlayerScores.append(PlayerScore)
# ...existing code...
````

---

## 6. **Why This Works**

- The dealer is always tracked at index 0.
- All ace-related functions (`ScoreCalc`, `SaveAces`, `CheckAces`) work for both dealer and players.
- No logic changes needed elsewhereâ€”just pass the correct index.

**If you want the dealer at the end instead of the start, just adjust the indexing accordingly.**
